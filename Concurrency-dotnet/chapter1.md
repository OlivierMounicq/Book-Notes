### 1. The concepts of the functionnal programming

__Functionnal programming__
* abstraction + computation
* avoiding the mutation of the data
* _stateless_ : the output only depends upon input and not the state of the program at execution time
* _expression_ : the functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of expressions.



* Before 2005 : single-core CPU
* A CPU single core performances stagnate

#### Terminology

* _sequential programming_ : _it refers to a set of ordered instrcutions executed one at time on one CPU._
    * e.g : for the each person in line, the barrista is sequentially repeating the same set of instructions (grind coffee, brew coffee, steam milk, froth milk, and combine the coffee, and the milk to make a cappucino  
    * __*convenience*__ : a clear set of systematic instructions of what to do and when to do  
    * inconvenience : the barista can when during a task
* _concurrent programming_ : _it handles several operations at one time and does not require hardware support._ (running multiple tasks at the same time.) _Concurrency_ describes the ability to run several programs at the same time.
    * e.g : the barrista switches between the preparation of the coffee and preparing the milk.
* _parallel programming_ : executing multiples tasks simultaneously on several CPU. It achieves only in multicore devices. The goal is to maximize the use of all available computational resources.
    * e.g : one barrista prepares the coffee and another one prepares the milk
* _multitasking_ : concurrently performs multiple threads from different processes.
* _multithreading_ : extends the multitaskings concept for only one process.
