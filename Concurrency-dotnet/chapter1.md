### 1. The concepts of the functionnal programming

__Functionnal programming__
* abstraction + computation
* avoiding the mutation of the data
* _stateless_ : the output only depends upon input and not the state of the program at execution time



* Before 2005 : single-core CPU
* A CPU single core performances stagnate

#### Terminology

* _sequential programming_ : accomplishing things in step  
-e.g : for the each person in line, the barrista is sequentially repeating the same set of instructions (grind coffee, brew coffee, steam milk, froth milk, and combine the coffee, and the milk to make a cappucino  
-convenience : a clear set of systematic instructions of what to do and when to do  
-inconvenience : the barista can when during a task
* _concurrent programming_
