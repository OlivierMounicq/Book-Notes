####  Thread contention

A Thread contention is a condition where one thread is waiting for an object, being held by another thread, to be released.  The waiting thread cannot continue until the other thread releases the object (itâ€™s locked).


#### System.Collection.Immutable

The namespace ```System.Collection.Immutable``` hase been added with the .NET 4.5 framework.  
The _immutable collection_ follows the functional paradigm.  

Any operations that change the data strctures don't modify the original instance. Instead, they return a changed copy and leave the original instance unchanged.

 The immutable collections have  been  heavily  tuned  for  maximum  performance  and  use  the  [Structural  Sharing pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) to minimize garbage collector (GC) demands.
 
 ```cs
 var originalDictionary = new Dictionary<int,int>().ToImmutableDictionary();
 var modifiedCollection = originalDictionary.Add(key, value); //Return a new instance of the dictionary
 ```
 
 => Any changes to the collection in one thread are not visible to the other threads.

 | Immutable collection             | Mutable collection      |
 |----------------------------------|-------------------------|
 | ImmutableList<T>                 | List<t>                 |
 | ImmutableDictionary<TKey,TValue> | Dictionary<TKey,TValue> |
 | ImmutableHashSet<T>              | HashSet<T>              |
 | ImmutableStack<T>                | Stack<T>                | 
 | ImmutableQueue<T>                | Queue<T>                |
